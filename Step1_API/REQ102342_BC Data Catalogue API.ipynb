BC Stats annually releases total population estimates for sub-provincial region types. These estimates are consistent in aggregate with the July 1st provincial level estimates produced by Statistics Canada. More information can be found on BC Stats' [Population Estimates page](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=36D1A7A4BEE248598281824C13CB65B6).\n","\n","Projections: A population projection is a forecast of future population growth. BC Stats applies the Component/Cohort-Survival method to project the population. This method \"grows\" the population from the latest base year estimate by forecasting births, deaths and migration by age. These forecasts are based on past trends modified to account for possible future changes and, consequently, should be viewed as only one possible scenario of future population. Projections are also released annually and are as of July 1st.
